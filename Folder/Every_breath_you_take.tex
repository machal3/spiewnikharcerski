Every breath you take, & \textbf{G} \\
And every move you make & \textbf{e} \\
Every bond you break, every step you take, & \textbf{C D} \\
I'll be watching you & \textbf{e} \\
& \\
Every single day, & \textbf{G} \\
Every word you say & \textbf{e} \\
Every game you play, every night you stay, & \textbf{C D} \\
I'll be watching you & \textbf{e} \\
& \\
Oh can't you see, & \textbf{C} \\
You belong to me & \textbf{G} \\
How my poor heart aches & \textbf{A7} \\
With every step you take & \textbf{D} \\
& \\
Every move you make & \textbf{G} \\
And every vow you break & \textbf{e} \\
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, & \textbf{C D} \\
I'll be watching you & \textbf{e} \\
& \\
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace & \textbf{Es} \\
I dream at night I can only see your face & \textbf{F} \\
I look around, but it's you I can't replace & \textbf{Es} \\
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace & \textbf{F} \\
I keep crying baby, baby, please & \textbf{Es G} \\
& \\
Oh can't you see...  & \\
& \\
Every move you make...  & \\
