Another head hangs lowly, & \textbf{e C} \\
Child is slowly taken. & \textbf{G D} \\
And the violence caused such silence, & \textbf{e C} \\
Who are we mistaken? & \textbf{G D} \\
& \\
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family. & \textbf{e C} \\
In your head, in your head, they are fighting. & \textbf{G D} \\
& \\
\hspace*{2em}\textit{With their tanks and their bombs,} & \textbf{e} \\
\hspace*{2em}\textit{And their bombs, and their guns.} & \textbf{C} \\
\hspace*{2em}\textit{In your head, in your head, they are crying.} & \textbf{G D} \\
& \\
\hspace*{2em}\textit{In your head, in your head,} & \textbf{e C} \\
\hspace*{2em}\textit{Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie} & \textbf{G D} \\
\hspace*{2em}\textit{What's in your head?} & \textbf{e} \\
\hspace*{2em}\textit{In your head,} & \textbf{C} \\
\hspace*{2em}\textit{Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie} & \textbf{G D} \\
& \\
Another mother's breakin', & \textbf{e C} \\
Heart is taking over. & \textbf{G D} \\
When the violence causes silence, & \textbf{e C} \\
We must be mistaken. & \textbf{G D} \\
& \\
It's the same old theme, since 1916. & \textbf{e C} \\
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting, & \textbf{G D} \\

\hspace*{2em}\textit{With their tanks and their bombs...}  & \\

\hspace*{2em}\textit{In your head, in your head...}  & \\

\hspace*{2em}\textit{Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,}  & \\
\hspace*{2em}\textit{hey, oh, ya, ya-a...}  & \\
